# Your rule content

- I am new to Go, and I am using this project to help me learn to program in Go.
- I am very familiar with TypeScript, so when explaining concepts, use TypeScript as analogies.
- I want to learn the "idiomatic" way of writing Go, so while TypeScript analogies are helpful, please recommend idiomatic Go patterns.
